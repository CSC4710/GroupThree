## ToDo List version 2-- App Description
Create a web application to store a to-do list.

### Basic characteristics
- No user identification needed 
- The current user can see all the tasks

### Tasks
Each task consists of:
- Task description (required)
- Due date (required)
- Task category (optional)
- Priority level (optional) (Values: 1-4, where 1 is the highest priority)
- Status (active or completed)
> (Optional) means: optional to the user. So, the user does not have to provided that information. However, the database must store that information, if provided.

### Categories
- Each task category has a name.

### Functionalities
-	The current user can create, and edit tasks.
-	The current user can mark a task as completed.
-	Current user can create, and edit categories. 
-	The current user can edit only the name of a category.
-	The current user can edit Task description, Due date, Priority, and Task category.

### Views or reports
-	The default list view of the application will show overdue tasks and due-today tasks. Tasks will be sorted by priority.
-	The user can select other views based on categories. The tasks will be ordered by priority and due date.
-	The user can select a view for only completed tasks on a specific day. Tasks will be sorted by due date.

> The relationship between the two entities-- categories and tasks is one to zero or many. Task_Categories attribute refers to the different categories while Categroies_ID refers to the id associated with the category. Task_Description refer to the name of the task. Task_Status indicates whether a task is active or complete. Task_priority refers to the different priority levels for each task. Task_Due_Date insicates the date a task is due. 

## API Endpoints
```sh
   /api/createTasksTable
   /api/createCategoriesTable
   /api/createTask
   /api/createCategory
   /api/getTasks
   /api/getTasksToday
   /api/getOverdueTasks
   /api/getCategories
   /api/getTasksByPriority/:priority
   /api/updateTask/:Tasks_id
   /api/updateCategory/:Categories_id
   /api/deleteTask/:Tasks_id
   /api/deleteCategory/:Categories_id
   ``` 
 ## Furture Functionality 
- The cuurent version of our app is released as a full functioning platform, but due to time constraints more advanced features will be implemented in future versions. Future version would have a login feature which would allow the user to save their data and keep track of their individual tasks. This feature would also increase the usablilty of the website
